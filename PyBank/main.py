# import/read the csv
# 
# In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. 
# You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 
# (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

#1. The total number of months included in the dataset
#do this: 
# creating lists/blank lists

#2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#do this: 
# Net Total = 0, adding to that variable as you go through.
    
#3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#do these: 
# use the append function as you loop through
#adding values to lists; then how many values are in those lists?
#storing changes #

#4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#do this: 
# max(the list in which i've stored all the month to month changes)

#5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
#do this: 
# min(the list in which i've stored all the month to month changes)
